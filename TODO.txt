- Make it easier for code completion environments to create
  unit signatures, i.e. make a namespace for the signatures, 
  e.g.:

import unity as u
import unity.category as uc


#  These dots will allow code completion environments
#  to provide the user with options for completion,
#  which will make the module much easier to use.
#
#                   |
#                   |
#                   V
@unit_signature(n=uc.substance, T=uc.Temperature, P=uc.Pressure)  
def ideal_gas_volume(n, T, P):
    R = 8.314*u.J/u.mol/u.K
    return n * R * T / P

- Should also consider adding a module of common calculations,
  e.g.

import unity.engineering.state (contains e.g. ideal gas, etc)
import unity.engineering.flow  (pipe flow, hydrostatic head etc)

- Consider rather calling the function decorator "units", e.g.:

@units(r='Length')
def area_circle(r):
    return pi*r**2

- Hide more of the methods on a unitized variable (with leading "_").

- Consider: if a quantity is entered in a certain unit, make that the
  default unit (setRepresent IOW)

- Additions:
    ncmh Ncmh Nm3/hr scmh
